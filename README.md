# Bitcoin Trading Simulator
This is a project that was completed for my A-Level coursework project. It is one of the first projects I completed that involved developing a full application
from the analysis stage to a final product.

The goal is allow users to learn to trade cryptocurrency risk-free. The program allows the user to simiulate buying and selling activity without 
risking any real funds. The interface is structured simliarly to a typical cryptocurrency exchange. 

The application was developed with Python using libraries such as Tkinter, Matplotlib.
