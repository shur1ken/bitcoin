# bitcoin investment simulator
Im new to programming. This was done for my final high school coding project. It allows the user to simulate investing in Bitcoin
allowing them to learn without putting real life funds at risk. The application is structured simliarly to a typical cryptocurrency
exchange with greatly reduced features. For the purposes of this project, there is only support for Bitcoin. Any advice on how this can 
be improved is welcome.
